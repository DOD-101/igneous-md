## Getting started

1. Create the config directory at `~/.config/igneous-md/`
<!-- TODO: Add example config.toml -->
2. In the config directory add `config.toml` (optional) & `css/`
<!-- TODO: Add example css -->
3. Add some css files in the `css/` directory. These are the files that will be used to style your markdown. 

4. Find a markdown file you want to view and run `igneous-md --path path/to/file.md`


<!-- TODO: ## Integration with Neovim -->

## FAQ

> Or at least questions I think people could ask

1. How do I view my markdown in the browser?

    Simply pass the `--browser` flag. For all options run `igneous-md`
